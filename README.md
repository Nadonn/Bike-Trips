## 🧠 Key Insights
📌 1. Usage Behavior Differences: Annual Members vs Casual Riders
Trip Duration: Casual riders have longer average ride durations (~35 minutes), while annual members average around 15–20 minutes, indicating members use bikes for commuting, while casuals ride for leisure.

Day of Week: Members primarily ride during weekdays (especially during morning and evening rush hours), while casual riders are more active on weekends.

Start/End Stations: Members tend to start and end at the same locations (e.g., train stations, office areas), suggesting a structured travel pattern. Casual riders more often take one-way leisure rides.

📌 2. Motivations for Casual Riders to Become Members
Repeat Usage: A segment of casual riders (>25%) uses the service multiple times per month. These riders could benefit financially from switching to a membership.

Popular Ride Times: Some casuals consistently ride during weekdays — mirroring member behavior — suggesting they might be open to membership with the right incentive.

Frequent Start Locations: Many casual riders frequently start from stations in residential areas, implying a potential for regular commuting.

📌 3. Digital Media Strategy Suggestions
Targeted Social Ads: Run geo-targeted ads focusing on users who frequently ride from residential neighborhoods to downtown, highlighting cost-saving benefits of memberships.

Email Marketing: For registered casual users, send personalized emails when they hit a certain number of rides per month (e.g., “You’ve taken 5 trips this month — save $X by switching to a membership!”).

In-app Promotions: Offer trial memberships or discounted first-month plans directly in the app to convert high-usage casual riders.
